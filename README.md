I'm a **Ph.D. student at Seoul National University**, working on AI-powered design for elastic metamaterials.

### ðŸ”¬ What I do
- ðŸŽ¯ **Inverse design with deep learning**  
  Generate structures that meet specific performance goals.
- âš¡ **Surrogate modeling**  
  Speed up forward simulations with lightweight, ML-based models.
- ðŸ¤– **Autonomous design with Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
  Explore agent-based workflows for fully automated, intelligent design processes.

Always looking for smarter and faster ways to design better materials!
